<p>Snake-Game is a old but very popular game.<br>
This game is always reminiscent of the first cells phone that came out.<br><br>
"Snake" is a very easy game at beginning but after becomes more, and more difficult.<br>
This game can train the logic and reaction of each person.<br><br>
The game has the "Score" option where you can see how much food your snake actually eat.<br>
At the end of the you have the "Final Score" option where you can see how many points did you get.<br> <br>
This project is the third of five milestone projects that needs to be completed by me in order to obtain the Full Stack Development Diploma from <a href="https://codeinstitute.net/">Code Institute</a> <br>
Required technologies for the project: <b><u>Python</u></b><br><br>
A live version of this project can be found <a href="https://snake-game-sbn.herokuapp.com/">here!</a><hr>
